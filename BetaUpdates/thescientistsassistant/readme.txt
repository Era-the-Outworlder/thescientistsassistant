The Scientist's Assistant.

They're here.

Maybe this isn't where they're supposed to be... but maybe it's for the best they're here with you. 
Here with you to respond to the aftermath of something horrible. A disaster beyond proportions.
But now with you, they'll be safe.
Right?
Take good care of them.
Perhaps you're all they'll have.
